<p dir="auto">This is simply a fun project. I chose to focus on learning how websites are produced and seeing what I can achieve, and I intended to divide the effort into different parts to make it more interesting and easier for me.</p>
<ol>
<li dir="auto">I will begin by developing the website with WordPress with the assistance of various free plugins and ready-to-use themes.</li>
<li dir="auto">I'm going to try to make a custom theme with elemintor.</li>
<li dir="auto">I want to use HTML to develop my own theme.</li>
<li dir="auto">I will attempt to design my own custom plugin that will allow the project to function.</li>
<li dir="auto">I intend to rebuild the entire website in php without the assistance of WordPress.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">I am currently working on a Life Expectancy Calculator that combines medical and scientific data to estimate how old you will live to be. The calculator should allow the user to change their daily habits in order to live longer.</p>
<p dir="auto">I am still new to Github and these types of projects; I will do my best to understand how everything works. My project files are now empty since I am still in the early stages; I will attempt to update the files as much as I can as I progress.</p>
<p dir="auto">The website's name is&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/theexpecter/lifexpect/blob/main/lifexpect.com">lifexpect.com</a>, and there is only one page where the calculator is located. it shows a list of questions related to your health, family history, and daily habits. the accuracy of the calculation for a specific person may not be extremely high, but it tries to maintain accuracy when it comes to the overall average.</p>
